/// `SimplyCoreAudio` provides convenient audio hardware-related functions (e.g. obtaining all devices managed by
/// Core Audio) and allows audio hardware-related notifications to work. Additionally, you may create and remove
/// aggregate devices using this class.
///
/// - Important: If you are interested in receiving hardware-related notifications, remember to keep a strong reference
/// to an object of this class.
///
/// However, *do not* keep more than one instance of this class at the same time to avoid receiving duplicated
/// notifications.
///
/// As soon as the last remaining instance of this class is deallocated, hardware-related notifications will no longer
/// be delivered.
///
/// We could have designed this class to always return a shared instance, but ultimately decided to allow developers
/// total control so they have the chance to cleanup any resources used by `SimplyCoreAudio` such as hardware-related
/// Core Audio property listeners by simply deallocating any instances of this class.
